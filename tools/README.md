Various and Sundry Other Things
===============================
Contained in this directory are various and sundry other things which are handy
to have around when using curlrevshell.

Run `make tools` from the root of this repository to build the tools.

Linux users will probably need BSD Make.  Should be something like
`apt/yum/such install bmake` and probably either an alias named `make` pointing
at `bmake` or manually adding `b` to `make`, as appropriate.

Tools
-----
The following tools are available

Name                                 | Description
-------------------------------------|------------
[`funcgen`](./src/funcgen/README.md) | Generates files for use with `-callback-template` and `-ctrl-i-file`

Adding a tool
-------------
Tools will be automagically built by the [main Makefile](../Makefile)  from
directories in [`./src`](./src), providing the following conditions are met:
1.  The tool has a Makefile in it's own directory.
2.  The tool is made by it's Makefile's default target, which creates a file
     with the name name as the directory in this directory (e.g.
    [`./src/funcgen/Makefile`](./src/funcgen/Makefile) creates
    `./funcgen`.
3.  The Makefile also includes a `clean` target which, aside from whatever
    other cleaning needs to be done, removes the file generated by condition 2. 

In other words, to make a new tool:
```sh
# Work out what to call the tool
NAME=cooltool

# Make a directory for the tool
mkdir ./src/$NAME && cd ./src/$NAME

# Add a makefile
cat <<'_eof' >Makefile
BIN   = ../../$(.CURDIR:T)
SRCS != find . ! -path $(BIN) -a ! -name '.*'

# Build the tool
$(BIN): $(SRCS)
	echo '#!/bin/sh\necho "It Works!"' > $@
	chmod 0755 $@

# Remove the built tool
.PHONY: clean
clean:
	rm -f $(BIN)
_eof

# Modify the Makefile and maybe add source code
vim ./Makefile

# Build the tool
cd ../../../ && make tools/$NAME
```
