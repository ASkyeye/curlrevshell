Key Combinations
================
Certain key combinations do more than just send a line to the shell.
They are...

Combination | Mnemonic | Description
------------|----------|------------
`Ctrl+I`    | Insert   | Insert the file specified with [`-ctrl-i`](./flags.md#-ctrl-i)
`Ctrl+O`    | Oof      | Mute terminal output until it's calm again
`Tab`       | Tinsert  | Same as `Ctrl+I`

Plus a handful of
[readlineish](https://github.com/magisterquis/goxterm/blob/master/terminal.go#L182-L200)
ones which will be documented.  One day.
